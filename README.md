 2. Sign in with username and password which you created during signup process  
 3. One can see few offers along with a transfer money and recharge button.  
 4. Firstly one needs to complete further registration by adding Credit Card details and Profile.
 5 navigation of both is on the downside of the app window.
 6. After completing both profile and credit card, one can do task like recharge, buy from the offers, transfer money to someone  
 7. All these features have working logic along with server implementation too.  
 8. For example, when one buys something from main offer page, its account balance gets reduced by that much amount and he gets some redeem point too according to the problem statement  
 which can be seen in the wallet section of the app  
 9. Similarly, other features include review of transactions done, monthly insights from the transactions etc  
 10. The project consists of both a web app and a mobile app. Web App is just an API based APP written in Django and Hosted on Heroku and Mobile app consumes API services like authentication,   
 fetching of data, handling every other feature of the application.
